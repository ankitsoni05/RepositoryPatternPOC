**Continous Integeration / Continous (Deployment / Delivery)**

**Continous integration** 
1. Developers merge their changes back to main branch as often as possible.
2. Then developers changes are validated by creating a build and running automated testsagainst the build.
3. CI puts a great emphasis on testing automation to check that the application is not broken whenever new commits are integrated into the main branch.

**Continous Deployment**
- **Defination** :- The practice of automatically releasing changes to production once they pass automated tests and quality checks.
- **For Whom ?** :- Organizations that release new features on a daily and hourly basis.
- **Automation Effort** :- Requires a high degree of automation to ensure that changes are automatically deployed to production **without human intervention.**
- **Release Frequency** :- Frequently, often multiple times a day.
- **Scope of Deployment **:- Entire application or system.
- **Risk Management**:- Requires robust automated testing and quality assurance processes to minimize the risk of bugs or issues in production.
- **Customer Feedback**:- Enables faster feedback loops from users as changes are deployed quickly.
- **Rollback Capability**:- Easy to roll back changes as the process is automated.
- **Team Collaboration**:- Close collaboration between developers, testers, and operations teams is crucial for rapid and seamless deployment.
- **Use Cases**:- Ideal for organizations with a high demand for rapid changes and innovation, such as web-based applications or SaaS products.


**Continous Delivery**

- **Definition**:- The practice of ensuring that software is always ready for release by automating the build, testing, and deployment processes.
- **For Whom ?**:- Organizations that want to stage new features and releases on a frequent schedule.
- **Automation Effort**:- Also requires automation but allows for manual approval/coordination.
- **Release Frequency**:- Regularly, typically scheduled intervals.
- **Scope Of Deployment**:- Can be a subset of features or components of the application.
- **Risk Management**:- Emphasizes rigorous testing and quality assurance, but allows for manual intervention if required.
- **Customer Feedback**:- Feedback loops may be slower as releases are controlled and scheduled.
- **Rollback Capability**:- Rollbacks may require manual intervention or coordination.
- **Use Cases**:- Suitable for organizations with regular release cycles and a focus on stability and reliability.
