**Three Pillars of Scrum.**	
  1. **Transparency** - requires all team members to be included in all activities required for a project. Events like Daily         Scrums support this pillar. This pillar requires all members of the team to embrace openness and trust while working           toward a common goal.
  2. **Inspection** - ensures that teams prioritize tasks and that the product is of high quality. Events like Sprint Reviews         support this pillar. This pillar requires flexibility and collaboration between the team and the customer to ensure the        best possible product.
  3. **Adaptation** - is apparent across all Scrum events. It focuses on one of the main aspects of being Agile, which is to          always be flexible to accommodate the project and customersâ€™ needs. Any changes identified in the Inspection pillar            should be accommodated during Adaptation, with continued flexibility and collaboration between the team and the customer.
