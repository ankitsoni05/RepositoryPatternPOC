**Scrum & Kanban**
Agile is a methodology based on:-  
  1. 4 elements
  2. 3 agile Mindset.
  3. 4 agile Values
  4. 12 agile principles.

**When Waterfall will still be the preferred approach.**
  1. When the project/ requirement/ customer demand is not prone to change.
  2. The project is small in scope.
  3. When speedy delivery is not an priority.

**Scrum :-** Scrum is a framework based on agile values, mindset and principles in mind. Scrum is a framework that unites business and development, It focuses on the team delivering the highest values while also being productive and efficient.

**Generally, the 2 Sides of a project are in the scrum**  
  1. Business - This side is typically represented by the product owner (PO).
  2. Development - This side is typically represented by the Development Team and Scrum Master.

**Three Pillars of Scrum.**	
  1. **Transparency** - requires all team members to be included in all activities required for a project. Events like Daily         Scrums support this pillar. This pillar requires all members of the team to embrace openness and trust while working           toward a common goal.
  2. **Inspection** - ensures that teams prioritize tasks and that the product is of high quality. Events like Sprint Reviews         support this pillar. This pillar requires flexibility and collaboration between the team and the customer to ensure the        best possible product.
  3. **Adaptation** - is apparent across all Scrum events. It focuses on one of the main aspects of being Agile, which is to          always be flexible to accommodate the project and customersâ€™ needs. Any changes identified in the Inspection pillar            should be accommodated during Adaptation, with continued flexibility and collaboration between the team and the customer.

**Kanban**
1. Kanban comes from the Japanese word Kamban, which means signboard is a visual system that is used for managing work as it goes through the process
2. The main focus of Kanban is transparency.
3. With the help of the Kanban board it is very easily possible to determine bottlenecks and then fix them in cost 
cost-effective manager and at optimal speed.
4. Since everything is on board everyone can keep themselves updated, it also ensures the team focus on their current task until it's done.

**How Scrum and Kanban are Similar?**
1. Lean & Agile:- This means waste reduction and both are time-boxed and iterative approaches that enable product delivery in an incremental manner.
2. Reduce Work In Progress:-  This forces the team to ensure that they focus on a smaller set of tasks, this also makes blockers and bottlenecks a little bit more visible.
3. The Work is broken into Pieces: The work is divided into smaller, more manageable units.
4. Both use Pull Scheduling means products are built more on demands rather than on forecasts.
5. Transparency drives process improvement:-
6. The Release Plan is optimized continuously:-
7. Releasable software is delivered often and earlier:-
