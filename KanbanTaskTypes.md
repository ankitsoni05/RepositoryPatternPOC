**Cost of Delay (CoD)**
- All classes are defined by focusing on the cost of delay.
- Which helps to measure business impact if something is done later than earlier or first instead of last.
- It works as a perfect guidance tool when people responsible for work organization need to select priorities for each task.

**Kanban Task Types**
1. Expedite
2. Fixed deadline
3. Standard
4. Intangible

**Expedite**
1. Expedite tasks in Kanban are items or work items that are given priority and are intended to be completed as quickly as possible, often ahead of other work in progress.
2. These tasks are typically urgent and may have a higher business value or criticality compared to other items in the workflow.
3. The purpose of expedite tasks is to respond swiftly to unexpected issues, emergencies, or high-priority customer requests.

**Fixed Deadline**
1. Fixed deadline tasks in Kanban are work items or tasks that have a specific, non-negotiable deadline by which they must be completed.
2. These tasks are time-sensitive and must be delivered within a predefined timeframe, regardless of other work in progress.
3. Fixed deadline tasks are typically associated with external commitments, such as customer agreements, legal requirements, or contractual obligations.

**Standard**
Here all the regular tasks should go. They should be ordered with the first in, first out (FIFO) principle. The cost of delay for such tasks grows faster in the early days but then plateaus over time as they have no fixed date or strict urgency.

**Intangible**
1. In Kanban, "intangible tasks" refer to work items or tasks that are non-physical or abstract in nature, as opposed to tasks that involve tangible or physical objects.
2. These intangible tasks often relate to knowledge work, services, and information processing.
