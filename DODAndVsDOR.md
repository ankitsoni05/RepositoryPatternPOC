**What is Definition of Ready ?**

- It is important that the team must have a shared understanding on what the term "Ready" means.
- So, basically Definition of Ready (DOR) is certain set of criteria which needs to met before considering the user story is ready for development.
- DOR ensures that no surprised or last minute changes pops up once works begins.

**General Criteria for DOR**
- Team has agreed on definition and conditions required to start work on item.
- Goal is to eleminate surprised or last minute changes.
- Team should understand what "Ready" means.
- Ready means items should not require any further discussion before we begin.

**What is Definition of Done ? **
- The DOD is set of criteria that must ensure all work is complete and meets necessary quality standards before it can be released.
- The condition depends on team's process and conventions, but generally the team should agree on the definition.

  **Difference between DOD and DOR.**

  - The big difference is when both definitions are applied, DOR is applied before the user story is considered "Ready" for development, whereas DOD is        applied to set certain criterias that must be met before a User Story can be considered complete and ready for production.
  - The Definition of Ready focuses on ensuring the team is prepared to begin work on a user story. In contrast, the Definition of Done focuses on             ensuring that the user story is complete and meets all requirements.
